# IEEE Website (Jekyll)
Migrate the entire IEEE Main Website to Jekyll for better and easier maintenance. This repository is created for development purposes. Will move all code to the main repo once complete.

### General Instructions
1. Install Jekyll on your systems by following [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. Clone the repo and run `jekyll serve`.
3. Do not make changes to `style.css` or `bootsrap.css` unless the changes are meant to impact the entire site. If you have to add CSS for your own pages only, make a new CSS file, or edit existing ones (if they do) and refernce them in the `head`.
4. The theme is taken from [here](https://preview.colorlib.com/theme/unapp/). Please try to stick to the theme as much as possible.
